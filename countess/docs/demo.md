# COUNTESS Demo Script (60–90s)

## 0:00–0:10 — Intro Frame
- Open with the desktop shell visible.
- Call out that COUNTESS is simulation-only and themed like Windows Terminal.

## 0:10–0:25 — Layout Tour
- Point to left pane logs (engine events, credit updates).
- Point to right pane blackjack table cinematic playback.
- Highlight taskbar + chrome realism.

## 0:25–0:45 — Survival Economy
- Trigger several hands.
- Explain burn-per-hand and positive-profit tax into credits.
- Mention auto-refill threshold behavior.

## 0:45–1:05 — Cinematic Playback
- Hit DEAL and narrate incremental trace: deal, split/hit/stand/double, reveal, settle.
- Toggle “Reveal hole” to show dealer hole-card behavior.

## 1:05–1:25 — Autoplay + HUD
- Enable autoplay and show fake LIVE metrics (viewers, ping, FPS, uptime).
- Mention the DEAD state condition when credits are exhausted.

## 1:25–1:30 — Close
- Reiterate: this is an educational simulation UI, not real casino automation.
